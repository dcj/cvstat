
cvstat is usefully for the project manager to statistics and analysis CVS log, it import 
cvs log to a sqlite3 db, so the PM can use SQL query the db.

the GUI is based on Qt 4.5, so it will be run at the platform that Qt supported.

build cvstat is same as build other Qt application, the src\cvsstat.pro is the qmake
input, in build forlder, there has CMake build input too.
